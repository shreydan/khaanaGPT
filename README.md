# 🍲️ खानाGPT

### Try it out at [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shreydan/khaanaGPT)

Just a basic app to generate Indian recipes from listed ingredients. It's good, not great, it might add more ingredients or ignore some existing ingredients.

This was my first attempt at fine-tuning causalLM models. I used `GPT-2 Small` for this and it was fun, learnt a lot and the outputs are as expected.
